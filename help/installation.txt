To get this code running at all, you will need at least:
- The entire PyMMT directory (duh)
- Python 2.7
- numpy (a Python package)
- srptools (a Python package I wrote containing various tools)
- the java command-line utility

If you want to be able to compile the Java subprogram, you will also need:
- the javac command-line utility

How to get all those things:
- PyMMT is a git repository at "https://github.com/speezepearson/PyMMT.git". If you don't know git or don't want the entire repository, you can get the latest version at "https://github.com/speezepearson/PyMMT/downloads".
- Python 2.7 is available from "http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/"
- numpy is available from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/"
- srptools is available on Wedge, in "Users/Spencer_Pearson/Python"
- java/javac come with the JDK: "http://tinyurl.com/jdk7-download"
